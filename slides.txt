	on redhat/centos:
		TBD

which version?
	current latest is 3.13
	on ubuntu you get 3.12

	Any version over 3.2 is recommended.

keeping things tidy
	using a new command that you write
		using the source control system
			git clean
			also add everything that is generated to .gitignore
		You can do similar things with other source control systems.
	using a new command to remove things which are
		generated without the source control system.
	using out of tree build.
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		all stuff is now in the 'build' folder.
		remove it and you clean everything.
	adding the cmake generated files to ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
		This isn't the best way.
